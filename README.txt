Jessica moved this site onto cors1601 in April 2016
At that time she created a new solr index for it using the existing xslt file in the search directory

Please refer to data_nebpubdocs for the XML content and solr population.

None of the solr scripts in this repository are used any longer for population.

This project has been added to git without consideration for portions which may no longer be used, such as the lewis and clark templates.
